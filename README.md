* As shown in the results above, the variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values are **vehicle lenght and ground clearance**

* Each independent variable in the model has its own slope, therefore we could consider that the slope of the model as a whole is zero.

* With a value of 0.71, we can conclude that the model predicts mpg of MechaCar protoypes effectively.
